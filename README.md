# Downtime Detector

https://downtimedetector.xyz

It is a simple downtime detector. A user can add any URL and the application will ping it every 5 minutes showing the result in the user's dashboard and optionally notifying the user via email if a problem occurs.

I'm developing the application using [Hanami web framework](https://github.com/hanami/hanami) which helps me a lot in keeping my architecture clean.
